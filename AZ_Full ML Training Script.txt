Full ML Training Script: Train & Save Alert Detection Model
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import joblib

# === Step 1: Load Training Data ===
# Your CSV should have features like 'severity', 'action', 'ip', and a target label column 'label'
# Example: label = 1 for restricted entry, 0 for normal
df = pd.read_csv("training_data.csv")

# === Step 2: Feature Engineering ===
df['action_length'] = df['action'].apply(len)  # Add length of action string as a feature
# You can add more features like keyword flags or frequency patterns

# Select features and labels
X = df[['severity', 'action_length']]
y = df['label']

# === Step 3: Train/Test Split ===
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# === Step 4: Train the Model ===
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# === Step 5: Evaluate ===
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("üîç Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nüìä Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# === Step 6: Save the Model ===
joblib.dump(model, "ml_model.pkl")
print("‚úÖ Model saved successfully as 'ml_model.pkl'")

üß† Helpful Tips
- Make sure training_data.csv has a balanced number of restricted (label=1) and normal (label=0) samples.
- You can improve accuracy by using NLP features, IP reputation scores, or historical context.
- To test the saved model:
model = joblib.load("ml_model.pkl")
preds = model.predict([[3, 25]])  # Example: severity=3, action_length=25



Would you like help enhancing this with text embeddings, anomaly detection, or real-time streaming? We can take it to the next level if you're ready. üòÑ
