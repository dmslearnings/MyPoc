When migrating from Java 8 to Java 17, there are several features and APIs that have been removed or deprecated. 
Here’s a summary of what’s been removed and some solutions or alternatives for each:

1. Removed Features and Solutions
1.1. javax.xml.bind (JAXB), javax.xml.ws (JAX-WS), javax.xml.soap
Removed: These Java EE APIs were removed in Java 11, but you may still encounter issues if migrating from Java 8 to Java 17.
Solution:
Use separate libraries for XML binding and web services:
JAXB: Use the jakarta.xml.bind module or Maven/Gradle dependencies for JAXB.
JAX-WS: Use the jakarta.xml.ws module or dependencies like javax.xml.ws-api or jaxws-api.
SOAP: Use libraries such as Apache CXF or other third-party libraries for SOAP support.
1.2. Security Manager
Removed: The Security Manager was deprecated in Java 17 for future removal.
Solution:
Security Manager Alternatives: If you rely on the Security Manager for fine-grained security policies, consider using modern alternatives like:
Java Platform Module System (JPMS): Utilize module boundaries and encapsulation.
Containerization: Use containers or sandboxing techniques to enforce security policies.
Policy-based Security: Implement custom security policies at the application level.
1.3. Thread.stop(), Thread.suspend(), Thread.resume()
Removed: These methods were deprecated due to their unsafe behavior and removed in later versions.
Solution:
Concurrency Alternatives: Replace usage with more robust concurrency mechanisms:
Thread.interrupt(): Use interrupt() to signal threads to stop working.
java.util.concurrent: Utilize concurrency utilities from java.util.concurrent such as Executors, CountDownLatch, Semaphore, etc.
1.4. Applet API
Removed: Applets were removed as they are outdated and no longer supported in modern browsers.
Solution:
Web Alternatives: Move to modern web technologies:
JavaFX: For rich client applications, consider using JavaFX.
Web Applications: Use frameworks like Spring Boot for web applications.
1.5. RMI Activation
Removed: RMI Activation was removed due to its deprecation.
Solution:
Alternative Remote Communication: Use alternative remote communication methods:
gRPC: Consider using gRPC for remote procedure calls.
REST APIs: Implement RESTful services using frameworks like Spring Boot or JAX-RS.
1.6. Nashorn JavaScript Engine
Removed: The Nashorn JavaScript engine was deprecated and removed in Java 15.
Solution:
Alternative JavaScript Engines: Use alternative engines or tools:
GraalVM: GraalVM includes a JavaScript engine that can be used as a replacement for Nashorn.
External Libraries: For embedding JavaScript, consider libraries like Rhino or GraalVM's JavaScript runtime.
Recommendations for Migration
Dependency Updates: Update your build scripts to include the necessary dependencies for libraries that replaced removed Java EE modules.
Code Refactoring: Refactor your code to replace removed or deprecated APIs with their modern equivalents.
Testing: Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the transition from Java 8 to Java 17 does not introduce regressions.
Documentation: Consult the Java Migration Guides and other resources to understand the impact of changes and to get specific guidance on migration.
