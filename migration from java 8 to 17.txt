=======Spring Boot microservices from Java 8 to Java 17 key risks and benifits=======================================

Migrating Spring Boot microservices from Java 8 to Java 17 involves several risks and benefits. Understanding these will help in planning 
and executing the migration more effectively.

Key Risks
Compatibility Issues:

	Deprecated and Removed APIs: Java 17 may have removed or deprecated APIs used in Java 8. This can lead to compilation errors or runtime exceptions if not addressed.
Library Compatibility: Third-party libraries and frameworks might not be compatible with Java 17. This can cause integration issues or require updates to newer versions.
Performance Variability:

	Performance Regression: While Java 17 generally offers performance improvements, thereâ€™s a possibility of unexpected performance regressions due to changes in the JVM or libraries.
Resource Usage: Changes in the Java memory model or garbage collection can impact resource usage, potentially affecting the performance of microservices.
Code Refactoring Complexity:

	Code Changes: Updating the codebase to replace deprecated APIs and take advantage of new features can be complex and time-consuming.
Testing Overhead: Extensive testing is required to ensure that the migration does not introduce new bugs or issues, which adds to the overall effort.
Dependency Management:

	Dependency Conflicts: Upgrading dependencies to versions compatible with Java 17 can lead to conflicts or issues with existing code, requiring additional refactoring.
Integration Testing: Ensuring that all integrated services and systems work seamlessly with the updated microservices can be challenging.
CI/CD Pipeline Disruptions:

	Pipeline Adjustments: Modifying CI/CD pipelines to build and deploy with Java 17 can disrupt existing workflows and require extensive validation.
Build Failures: Initial build or deployment failures may occur if the pipelines are not properly configured for Java 17.
Learning Curve:

	New Features: Developers may need to spend time learning new Java 17 features and best practices, which can slow down development initially.
