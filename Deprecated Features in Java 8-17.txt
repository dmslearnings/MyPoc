 Deprecated Features in Java 9-16
javax.annotation.processing.AbstractProcessor and javax.annotation.processing.Processor:

These annotations have been deprecated, and you should use the new javax.annotation.processing package or newer alternatives.
Thread.stop(), Thread.suspend(), Thread.resume():

These methods were deprecated in Java 9 due to their unsafe behavior. They are fully removed in later versions.
Applet API:

The Applet API has been deprecated and eventually removed in Java 9. The API is considered outdated and not used in modern Java development.
NIO 2.0:

The older java.nio.file.Files methods for file.walk and file.walkFileTree are deprecated, with newer file I/O APIs recommended.
Security Manager:

The Security Manager and its associated APIs have been deprecated in Java 17, with a plan to remove it in future releases.
RMI Activation:

Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Activation has been deprecated and is removed in newer versions. Alternatives are recommended.
2. Removed Features in Java 9-17
Java EE and CORBA modules:

These modules were removed starting from Java 11. They include various APIs for Java EE (Enterprise Edition) and CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture).
javax.xml.bind (JAXB), javax.xml.ws (JAX-WS), and javax.xml.soap:

These Java EE APIs were removed from the JDK in Java 11. They are now part of separate modules or libraries.
Security Manager:

As mentioned, the Security Manager is deprecated and targeted for removal.
RMI Activation:

RMI Activation has been removed since Java 15.
Applets:

Applets have been fully removed from the JDK since Java 9.
JDK Tools:

Some JDK tools and utilities have been deprecated and removed, such as javaws and javapackager.
Recommendations:
Update Dependencies: Ensure that any third-party libraries or frameworks you use are updated to be compatible with the latest Java versions.
Refactor Code: Refactor any deprecated API usage to use recommended alternatives. For example, replace Thread.stop() with more appropriate concurrency mechanisms.
Test Thoroughly: Given the substantial changes between Java 8 and Java 17, thorough testing is crucial to ensure your application behaves as expected.

======================================================

Removed Features and APIs
Java 9
javax.annotation.processing:

The javax.annotation.processing package has been deprecated and removed in favor of more modern annotation processing approaches.
Thread.stop(), Thread.suspend(), Thread.resume():

These methods were deprecated for removal due to their unsafe behavior and were removed in later versions.
Java EE Modules:

Modules such as javax.xml.bind, javax.xml.ws, javax.xml.soap, and javax.annotation were removed. These were part of the Java EE specification and are now available as separate libraries.
Applets:

The Applet API, used for Java applets in web browsers, was deprecated in Java 9 and removed in later versions.
Java 10
The -XX:+UseG1GC Garbage Collector Option:
This option was removed in favor of more modern garbage collection options.
Java 11
Java EE and CORBA Modules:

In addition to what was removed in Java 9, Java EE modules like javax.annotation, javax.xml.bind, and others were removed from the JDK in favor of external libraries.
JDK Packager:

The javapackager tool, used for packaging Java applications, was removed. The recommended replacement is jpackage, introduced in Java 14.
Nashorn JavaScript Engine:

The Nashorn JavaScript engine was deprecated in Java 11 and removed in Java 15.
Java 12-14
Legacy Socket API:
Various older network APIs were deprecated and removed. The Socket and ServerSocket APIs were updated to use the newer APIs and methods.
Java 15
RMI Activation:

The RMI Activation system was deprecated and then removed.
@Deprecated(forRemoval = true) Annotation:

Added to indicate features that are planned for removal in future versions.
Java 16
Security Manager:
The Security Manager API was deprecated for removal in Java 17. Although not yet removed in Java 16, it's planned for future removal.
Java 17
Security Manager:

The Security Manager is deprecated for removal and will be completely removed in a future version.
``Java EE Modules`:

Java EE modules like javax.xml.bind, javax.xml.ws, and javax.xml.soap were completely removed starting with Java 11, but their removal impacts applications moving from Java 8.
Recommendations for Migration
Update Dependencies: Replace any usage of removed or deprecated APIs with their modern equivalents or external libraries.

Refactor Code: Address the removal of older APIs like Applet, RMI Activation, and deprecated methods like Thread.stop() by refactoring your code.

Test Thoroughly: Ensure that your codebase is thoroughly tested to catch any issues arising from the removal of features.

Consult Migration Guides: Use the official Oracle and OpenJDK migration guides to understand the implications of these changes.
