=====================================
Programmatically via SSLContext Configuration
If you're setting up your own SSLContext (for example, in a Spring Boot microservice or custom HTTP client/server), you can specify which cipher suites are allowed.
SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLSv1.2");
sslContext.init(null, null, new SecureRandom());

SSLEngine engine = sslContext.createSSLEngine();
engine.setEnabledCipherSuites(new String[]{
    "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256", // allow only specific suites
    "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
});
------------------
Using JVM System Properties (Non-java.security method)
You can set system properties when launching your application:

-Dhttps.cipherSuites=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
--------------------
 For Embedded Web Servers (e.g., Spring Boot with Tomcat or Jetty)
If you're using Spring Boot and want to control ciphers at the embedded server level:

application.properties:


server.ssl.enabled-protocols=TLSv1.2
server.ssl.ciphers=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

----------------

server.ssl.enabled=true
server.ssl.protocol=TLS
server.ssl.enabled-protocols=TLSv1.2
# List only the ciphers you want to keep, excluding the one you want to disable
server.ssl.ciphers=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384


java \
  -Dserver.ssl.enabled=true \
  -Dserver.ssl.protocol=TLS \
  -Dserver.ssl.enabled-protocols=TLSv1.2 \
  -Dserver.ssl.ciphers=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 \
  -jar your-app.jar



----------
Spring Boot Needs Embedded SSL Setup
The server.ssl.* settings only apply if you're running your app with an embedded servlet container (like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) and have SSL enabled with a valid keystore.

You need to specify:
-Dserver.ssl.enabled=true \
-Dserver.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12 \
-Dserver.ssl.key-store-password=changeit \
-Dserver.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12 \
-Dserver.ssl.ciphers=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 \
-Dserver.ssl.enabled-protocols=TLSv1.2


-----
You can configure the embedded server programmatically as a fallback:
@Bean
public WebServerFactoryCustomizer<TomcatServletWebServerFactory> sslCustomizer() {
    return factory -> factory.addConnectorCustomizers(connector -> {
        connector.setProperty("ciphers", "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384");
        connector.setProperty("sslEnabledProtocols", "TLSv1.2");
    });
}

----------------

Use application.properties or -D Flags
‚úîÔ∏è In application.properties:
properties
Copy
Edit
server.ssl.enabled=true
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12
server.ssl.key-store-password=changeit
server.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12
server.ssl.protocol=TLS
server.ssl.enabled-protocols=TLSv1.2
server.ssl.ciphers=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
‚úîÔ∏è Or via command line:
bash
Copy
Edit
java \
  -Dserver.ssl.enabled=true \
  -Dserver.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12 \
  -Dserver.ssl.key-store-password=changeit \
  -Dserver.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12 \
  -Dserver.ssl.protocol=TLS \
  -Dserver.ssl.enabled-protocols=TLSv1.2 \
  -Dserver.ssl.ciphers=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 \
  -jar your-app.jar
‚úÖ 3. Verify What's Enabled
To make sure the insecure ciphers are disabled, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
openssl s_client -connect localhost:8443 -cipher 'ALL'
Then try connecting using a blocklisted cipher like TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA. If your app is configured correctly, the connection should fail.

‚úÖ 4. Optional Programmatic Control
For complete control (e.g., if you're using embedded Tomcat), do it in code:

java
Copy
Edit
@Bean
public WebServerFactoryCustomizer<TomcatServletWebServerFactory> sslCustomizer() {
    return factory -> factory.addConnectorCustomizers(connector -> {
        connector.setProperty("sslEnabledProtocols", "TLSv1.2");
        connector.setProperty("ciphers",
            "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256," +
            "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
        );
    });
}
========================================================

In Java 8 Spring Boot microservices, to exclude (disable) specific TLS cipher suites, you must explicitly configure only the allowed cipher suites ‚Äî because Java 8 and Spring Boot do not support blacklist-style exclusion directly.

‚úÖ Effective Way to Exclude a Cipher Suite
üéØ Let‚Äôs say you want to disable:
text
Copy
Edit
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
You do this by not including it in your server.ssl.ciphers list.

üîß In application.properties:
properties
Copy
Edit
server.port=8443
server.ssl.enabled=true
server.ssl.protocol=TLS
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12
server.ssl.key-store-password=changeit
server.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12
server.ssl.enabled-protocols=TLSv1.2
server.ssl.ciphers=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
This excludes all other ciphers, including the one you want to disable.

‚úÖ This is the official and correct method to exclude specific cipher suites in Java 8 + Spring Boot.

‚ö†Ô∏è What You Cannot Do
You cannot do something like:

properties
Copy
Edit
server.ssl.excluded-ciphers=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
This property does not exist in Spring Boot or Java 8.

There is no JVM-wide "blacklist" property for TLS ciphers unless you edit java.security (which we are avoiding).

üß™ How to Test That It's Excluded
Use openssl to try connecting with the excluded cipher:

bash
Copy
Edit
openssl s_client -connect localhost:8443 -cipher 'TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256'
You should see:

text
Copy
Edit
CONNECTED(00000003)
140735249105088:error:14094410:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:sslv3 alert handshake failure:ssl/record/rec_layer_s3.c:1544:SSL alert number 40
Would you like a working example project with a keystore you can test this on?



You said:
openssl s_client -connect localhost:8443

ChatGPT said:
Running the command:

bash
Copy
Edit
openssl s_client -connect localhost:8443
will try to establish an SSL/TLS connection to your Spring Boot app on port 8443. It shows details like:

The negotiated TLS version

The cipher suite used

The certificate presented

Any errors in the handshake

üîç Sample Successful Output
text
Copy
Edit
CONNECTED(00000003)
...
SSL-Session:
    Protocol  : TLSv1.2
    Cipher    : TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
...
This tells you your app is serving TLS 1.2 and using the expected cipher suite.

üõë To Test Cipher Exclusion
If you've excluded a specific cipher (e.g., TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256), try forcing it:

bash
Copy
Edit
openssl s_client -connect localhost:8443 -cipher 'TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256'
If it's truly excluded, you'll see:

text
Copy
Edit
CONNECTED(00000003)
140735249105088:error:14094410:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:sslv3 alert handshake failure
This means your Spring Boot config is correctly blocking that cipher suite.
